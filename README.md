Program to find branches form an image
    by Vincent Dekkers

To be able to run the program:
- make sure the 'git' command works in your command prompt (https://git-scm.com/install/windows)
- make sure the python and pip commands work in your command prompt (https://www.python.org/downloads/latest/pymanager/)
- python should be between 3.8 and 3.13. ('python -V' in cmd to check)

In cmd, navigate to the folder you want to use the project
run:
git clone https://github.com/VincentDekkers/BEP.git
BEP/install.bat

To run the program:
- Move the .tif or .ome.tif files to a subdirectory of BEP
- Adjust the path of these files in the settings.yaml
- Save settings.yaml
- Run 'python FindingBranches.py'

All other settings can be adjusted as well in this settings file. 
For more information regarding the main algorithm, refer to my BEP.
